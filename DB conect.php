<?php
return DB::table('cuentas')->where('status', 1)->orderBy('cuenta')->get();

This is a piece of code written in the Laravel PHP framework. It is performing a database query on the "cuentas" table, selecting only the rows where the "status" column is equal to 1, and ordering the results by the "cuenta" column in ascending order. The code is using the Laravel query builder, which is a simple and convenient way to interact with the database using an object-oriented syntax. The get() method is used to retrieve all the rows that match the specified conditions, and return them as an array of objects.



Donde puedo determinar la conexion de la base de datos que contiene la tabla 'cuenta'
In Laravel, the database connection settings are typically stored in the "config/database.php" file.

In this file, you will find an array of connection options for various database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. The array is defined with a set of key/value pairs, where the key represents the name of the connection and the value contains the connection information.

For example, the default connection is typically named "mysql", and the options for this connection include the host, port, database name, username, and password. You can also find the name of the connection that is being used in the config/database.php file.

You can also create new connections in this file, and select the connection you want to use in your code using the DB facade.

Copy code

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

$users = DB::connection('connection_name')->select('select * from users');

In the above example, 'connection_name' is the name of the connection that you want to use.
