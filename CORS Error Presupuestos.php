The modification of the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header in an Amazon RDS instance in AWS can be done in a few different places, depending on the specific use case and the environment in which the RDS instance is running.

If the RDS instance is running in a VPC and you want to allow access to the RDS instance from a specific IP address or range of IP addresses, you can do this by creating a security group and adding a rule to allow inbound traffic from the desired IP address or range.

If you are using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of your RDS instance, you can configure the load balancer to add the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header to the response.

If you are running your RDS instance on EC2 instance, you can use .htaccess file to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header for your application or you could use a reverse proxy

If you are running your RDS instance in a containerized environment, you could use a reverse proxy or middleware to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header for your application.

If you are using RDS proxy you could use the configuration file to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

If you are using a DB instance running on RDS, you could use the parameter group to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

It is important to note that the specific steps to modify the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header will vary depending on the specific environment and architecture of your RDS instance and the application that it is serving.
